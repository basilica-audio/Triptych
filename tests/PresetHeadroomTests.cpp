// The factory-preset headroom gate (issue #52).
//
// Nothing in this repo used to check what a factory preset does to the LEVEL of
// the signal it is handed. tests/PresetManagerTests.cpp asserts that every
// factory preset parses, loads, and lands its parameters in range - not that the
// result stays inside full scale. A preset that clips is a preset the user has
// to fix before they can even audition it, which is a defect and not
// gain-staging taste.
//
// This file is the gate for that. It renders every shipped factory preset
// through the real AudioProcessor at a documented reference input level and
// asserts the output peak stays below 0 dBFS. A preset added later that clips
// this reference fails here.
//
// WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO is level-match the presets to each other.
// The gate is a ceiling, not a target: a preset sitting well below the line is
// left exactly where its author put it. Relative loudness between presets is a
// voicing/taste question and is not decided here.

    // realism this particular assertion does not need, and cost that comparison.
